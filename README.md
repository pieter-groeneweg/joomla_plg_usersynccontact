Plugin to sync user profile data to linked contact details

When creating a new user with the plugin "User - Contact Creator" enabled, a User is automatically added as Contact.
When plugin "User - Profile" is enabled, nothing of the profile data is stored in Contact Details.

This plugin makes sure the data is synced from User -> Contact.
It does NOT sync reverse. This is of no use as admins can eventually add more Contacts to a User. It would create "off-sync" situations.

But as registered users on login may be able to change their profile (user profile that is), this will automatically be synced to their Contact details.


- it will sync default user profile fields to corresponding default contact detail fields
But since there are remaining fields in both that have no match between the two
- it can sync custom user fields to the remaining contact detail fields
- it can sync the remaining user profile fields to custom contact fields
And
- it can sync custom user fields to custom contact fields



--note: 
- translation files have not yet been created.
- instructions are in the configuration of the plugin. More explanatory to follow.
- Address fields, address1 and address2, in user profile will be concatenated with an EOL/LF in contact details Address.
